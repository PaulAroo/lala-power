# Smyth abstract domains for searching and optimising

Abstract domains based on the Smyth powerdomain.
The Smyth powerdomain allows to represent a collection of elements `{x1,..,xN}` interpreted disjunctively.
Abstract domains extending the Smyth powerdomain include search tree, branch and bound and embarrasingly parallel search.
